# Avant Garde #
Avant Garde is an AXAML previewer for the C# Avalonia Framework.

NB. Currently in "alpha".

It has the following features:

* **Avant Garde** is a standalone application, rather than an IDE extension. This means you can use in conjunction with
any IDE, where it can be used in "Stay on Top" mode in any area of spare desktop space.

* It provides a read-only view of your Avalonia project, watching for file changes. Previews are updated instantly the
moment you save AXAML changes from your IDE.

* It's built in **Project Explorer** can be conveniently closed so as to minimize the size the Avant Garde
window while you focus on a particular form.

* It is currently a read-only previewer, rather than a designer or editor. While it also able to browse image assets
and text files, the generation of AXAML previews is the primary use case.

Avant Garde requires the installation of the **Avalonia Nuget Package** in order to work because it utilizes the
"preview host" which ships with Avalonia.

Avant Garde is licensed under GPLv3. See license for details.
